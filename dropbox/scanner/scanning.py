# Name of code artifact: scanning.py 
# Brief description of what the code does: Scans barcodes using industrial scanner. Contains modified code from the vpatron/barcode_scanner_python repo which defends against the case where a would be attacker can't just enter things in 
# Programmerâ€™s name: Xavier Ruyle   
# Date the code was created: 2/20/25
# Preconditions: Industrial scanner hooked up to device 
# Postconditions: barcode scanned and printed to screen 
# Return values or types, and their meanings: N/A
# Error and exception condition values or types that can occur, and their meanings: N/A
# Side effects: 
# Invariants: N/A
